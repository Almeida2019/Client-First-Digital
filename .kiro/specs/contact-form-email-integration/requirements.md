# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing contact form on the Client-First Digital website to properly send form submissions directly to info@clientfirstdigital.com. Currently, the form uses a mailto link which opens the user's email client, but this approach has limitations and may not work on all devices or for users without configured email clients. The new implementation will provide a seamless, server-side email delivery system that integrates with the existing Zoho Mail infrastructure to ensure all contact form submissions reach the intended recipient reliably.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential client visiting the website, I want to submit the contact form and have my inquiry automatically sent to Client-First Digital, so that I can easily get in touch without needing to use my own email client.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user fills out the contact form with valid information THEN the system SHALL submit the form data to a backend service
2. WHEN the form is successfully submitted THEN the system SHALL send an email to info@clientfirstdigital.com containing all form data
3. WHEN the email is sent THEN the system SHALL display a success message to the user
4. WHEN the form submission fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
5. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As the business owner, I want to receive properly formatted emails from the contact form in my Zoho Mail inbox, so that I can easily understand and respond to customer inquiries within my existing email workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contact form is submitted THEN the email SHALL include the customer's name in a clear format
2. WHEN a contact form is submitted THEN the email SHALL include the customer's email address for easy reply
3. WHEN a contact form is submitted THEN the email SHALL include the selected service interest
4. WHEN a contact form is submitted THEN the email SHALL include the customer's message
5. WHEN a contact form is submitted THEN the email subject SHALL clearly indicate it's a new website inquiry
6. WHEN a contact form is submitted THEN the email SHALL be formatted in a professional, readable manner
7. WHEN a contact form is submitted THEN the email SHALL be delivered to the Zoho Mail inbox without being flagged as spam
8. WHEN replying to a contact form email THEN the reply SHALL go directly to the customer's provided email address

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want the contact form to handle errors gracefully, so that users have a good experience even when technical issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback to the user
3. WHEN the form submission times out THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest trying again
4. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's form data so they don't need to re-enter it

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the contact form to work reliably, so that I can submit inquiries regardless of my device or email client configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a mobile device THEN the contact form SHALL function identically to desktop
2. WHEN using different browsers THEN the contact form SHALL work consistently across all modern browsers
3. WHEN the user doesn't have an email client configured THEN the form SHALL still work properly
4. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the form SHALL provide a fallback submission method
5. WHEN the form is submitted multiple times quickly THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate submissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner using Zoho Mail with existing DKIM and domain verification, I want the contact form integration to leverage my current email infrastructure, so that I can manage all communications through my established Zoho workflow without additional DNS configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend sends emails THEN it SHALL use Zoho Mail SMTP servers (smtp.zoho.com) for delivery
2. WHEN emails are sent through the system THEN they SHALL utilize the existing DKIM signature (zmail._domainkey) for authentication
3. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL authenticate using existing Zoho Mail credentials for info@clientfirstdigital.com
4. WHEN emails are delivered THEN they SHALL leverage the existing domain verification (zb17784548.zmverify.zoho.com) 
5. WHEN the system sends emails THEN it SHALL respect Zoho Mail's daily sending limits (typically 250 emails/day for free accounts)
6. WHEN emails are sent THEN they SHALL maintain the existing domain reputation and deliverability standards
